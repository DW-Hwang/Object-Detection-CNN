# Image Object Detection
This repository is to showcase the implementation of the `Object Detection Algorithm(s)` with deep learning. Object Detection is a common Computer Vision problem which deals with identifying and locating object of certain classes in the image.

Unlike image localization, we do not get the prior information to the number of existing objects in the image. This would make the task even more challenging where the machine not only have to learn the location of the object, but also to identify all possible objects in the given image. Nonetheless, it is still interesting to start with the basic localization algorithm where we have trained our machine to detect the location of the chest in a given chest X-ray. 

We present our result as shown below (Green: predicted bounding boxes, Red: target truth) and the link to the training algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/DW-Hwang/Object-Detection-CNN/blob/master/Image%20Localization/Basic_localization.ipynb).
